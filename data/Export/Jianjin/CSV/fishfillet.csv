Canada and the U.S. share one of the largest trading relationships in the world, in part due to close cultural ties, and in part due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which allows U.S. companies to ship qualifying goods to Canada or Mexico duty-free."

In 2018, it bought $333 billion worth of fish fillets, the largest yield from any U.S. trading partner ever.

The U.S. and Japan recently signed the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement, which entered into force on January 1, 2020.  The relationship is important to the U.S. given its geopolitical interests in East Asia, and a majority of Japanese citizens consider the U.S. to be their closest ally."

The U.S.-Korea trade agreement entered into force on March 15, 2012, providing more opportunities for U.S. exporters to sell more goods to Korean customers.  As a result, South Korea has become one of the U.S.’s largest trading partners and one of the most geopolitically important in East Asia."
