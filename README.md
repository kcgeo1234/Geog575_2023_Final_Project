Target User Profile (Persona):
Name & Position: Paul Bunyan, Dane County resident

Background Description: Paul is a resident of Dane County, WI who's house is within the sewer service area regulated by the Madison Metropolitan Sewerage District.  He would like to know where his wastewater goes, in order to get a clearer picture of how his water use fits into the broader hydrological cycle in Dane County.  Paul knows that wastewater contains a lot of chemicals and bacteria with the potential to contaminate natural areas and drinking water supply if not properly treated.  He wants to see if his wastewater is affecting local wildlife areas, wetlands, recreation areas, or water sources.
