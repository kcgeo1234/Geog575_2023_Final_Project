 Shared_Repo for the Geog575 final project

Target User Profile (Persona):
Name & Position: Professor Bunyan is a professor of International Economics who needs to lecture his class on the U.S.'s role in international trade.  He would like to support this lecture by showing a quick snapshot of the scale of the U.S.'s exports and imports in various industries, as well as which countries the U.S. has strong trade relations with.  In this lecture, he would like to **compare** the exports of textiles to Mexico in 2021 and 2016.  He would also like to show any **trends**, **patterns**, and **clusters** of countries that the U.S. exports chemical products to.  Finally, he would like to **rank** the U.S.'s trade partners by percentage of U.S. metals they import.

Background Description: 
Scenario#1:
Upon arriving at the interface, the map shows a default selection for metal exports from the United States in 2021 with proportional symbols around each country that recieved U.S. metal imports in that year.  The professor hovers over each symbol to reveal a popup that shows a sparkline graph of metal exports from the U.S. to that country over time.  The professor then searches for Mexico using the search bar at the top and the map opens the popup window associated with the proportional symbol for Mexico. The professor then selects 2001 using a slider widget at the top and the proportional symbols update, and he points out to the class how Mexico's symbol shrinks.  Finally, he goes to the accordion side panel on the left, selects the "Machinery" dropdown menu, and then selects "Electrical Machinery and Electrics".  The proportional symbols update to display the data for U.S. exports of electrical machinery in 2001.  Finally, he changes the toggle at the top from exports to imports and the map reexpresses the proportional symbols to reflect the import data for electric machinery in 2001.
